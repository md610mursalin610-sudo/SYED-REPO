## The goal

- consistent grid layout
- crisp images
- smaller payloads

## Card thumbnails: the practical setup

### Use cropping instead of stretching

```css
.thumb {
  width: 100%;
  height: 320px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Keep files smaller

- export at reasonable resolution
- compress PNG/JPG
- prefer modern formats if possible

## Don’t forget caching

Static assets served from `public/` are cacheable on most hosts.

## Wrap up

Images are usually the biggest performance cost on a portfolio. Fixing thumbnails gives you instant visual consistency and faster loads.
