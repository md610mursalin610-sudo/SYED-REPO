## Why the first paragraph matters

Your blog list cards show an auto-generated excerpt. That means the first 2–4 lines of your post are doing double duty:

- setting context
- convincing the reader to click

## A simple formula

### 1. Start with a clear promise

Example:

> In this post you’ll learn how to keep cards consistent even when thumbnails are all different sizes.

### 2. Add one concrete detail

Mention the technique or outcome:

- `object-fit: cover`
- fixed card min-height
- actions aligned at the bottom

### 3. Keep it short

If your first paragraph is too long, the excerpt becomes noisy.

## Wrap up

Write for humans first, but remember: your opening paragraph is also your “ad copy” on the blog list page.
