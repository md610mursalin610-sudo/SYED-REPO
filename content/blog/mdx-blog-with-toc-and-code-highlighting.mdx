## Why TOC matters

A table of contents helps readers:

- jump to the section they need
- understand the article’s structure
- stay oriented on long pages

## Write headings intentionally

Use:

- `##` for main sections
- `###` for subsections

These headings are extracted into the TOC.

### Example code block

```js
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

## Keep typography readable

- line-height around 1.7–1.9
- headings with enough spacing
- avoid huge paragraphs

## Wrap up

Structure beats length. A well-structured short post often performs better than a long wall of text.
