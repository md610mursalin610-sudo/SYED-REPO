## The problem

In a grid layout, cards often break when:

- thumbnails have different aspect ratios
- titles are longer
- excerpts vary a lot

## A reliable approach



### 1. Fix the card width, not the content

Use a grid column size (example: 438px) and center items.

### 2. Crop images consistently

```css
.card-thumb {
  width: 100%;
  height: 320px;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

### 3. Let content fill the rest

Make the card a flex column and push actions to the bottom.

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 657px;
}
.actions {
  margin-top: auto;
}
```

## Result

- same visual rhythm
- better scan-ability
- cleaner portfolio/blog appearance
