## Before you deploy

### Validate routes

- Home: `/`
- Projects: `/project`
- Blog list: `/blog`
- Blog post: `/blog/[slug]`

### Check assets in `public/`

- images referenced by URL should exist
- filenames with spaces should be avoided (or URL-encoded)

## SEO basics

- meaningful titles
- descriptions for posts
- readable URLs (slugs)

## A small habit that saves hours

Open your site and click everything like a user would:

- navbar links
- blog cards
- buttons (GitHub/Live)

## Wrap up

Deploying is the easy part. Preventing regressions is the real skill—use checklists, keep changes small, and test the critical paths.
